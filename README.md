# MindMend: Mental Health Care Application

MindMend is a platform designed to support users' mental health and well-being. The application leverages artificial intelligence to analyze facial expressions for emotional state detection, allowing users to better understand their mental health. It also offers a feature for booking appointments with professional mental health caretakers, such as psychologists and therapists.

The system is designed to learn and improve over time. After each session, the AI processes the data and enhances its ability to offer personalized mental health solutions for future users.

## Key Features

- **Facial Emotion Detection**:
  - The AI detects emotional states from users' facial expressions, providing insights into their mental health. This allows the system to assess users' feelings in real-time, fostering a deeper understanding of their mental state.

- **Mental Health Professional Appointments**:
  - Users can schedule sessions with certified mental health professionals directly on the platform. Whether seeking counseling or therapy, users can easily find and book appointments.

- **AI Learning**:
  - MindMend's AI is designed to learn from every user interaction. As it gathers more data from sessions and interactions, the system's ability to offer tailored mental health advice improves, ensuring that future users receive better care.

## Purpose of the Project

MindMend was created with the goal of providing users with immediate, accessible mental health support. By integrating AI technology, the platform can provide personalized care that adapts to each user's emotional state. Additionally, the ability to connect with professional mental health providers helps ensure users receive expert guidance when needed.

The AI's continual learning process ensures that the platform remains effective and relevant, offering increasingly better solutions over time.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript, EJS templating engine
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **AI/ML**: Python (NLP and machine learning), PyTorch for facial expression recognition
- **Cloud**: AWS/Firebase for hosting and storage
- **Security**: GDPR/HIPAA compliant authentication and user data privacy

## How the AI Improves Over Time

1. **User Interaction**: During each session, the AI analyzes user emotions through facial recognition and interaction.
2. **Learning from Data**: After each session, the AI processes the data from that interaction to better understand how to respond to similar situations in the future.
3. **Personalized Recommendations**: As the AI learns from more sessions, it becomes better at offering tailored advice and solutions based on user history.
